# EpamTests
It was an interesting interview experience with EPAM System during May 2022. The whole process took 4 interviews, ranging from talent recruiter meeting, Live code test with senior developer, meeting with manager, and lastly an offer meeting with HR. Was offered a Software Engineer II role, but unfortunately due to some reasons I had choose to go with another offer on hands, it was a tough choice. This repo consist of the Angular question given to me during the live coding test session.

## To run the Front end and Back end
